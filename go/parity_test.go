// parity_test.go — cross-runtime conformance, driven by the shared
// `test/spec/*.tsv` fixtures at the repo root (see ../test/AGENTS.md).
//
// The fixture loader, the escape codec, the ERROR:<code> contract and the
// row loop all come from github.com/tabnas/support/go, whose TypeScript
// half ts/test/parity.test.ts uses to run the SAME files — so the two
// implementations cannot drift without one of them going red, and neither
// can the two loaders.
//
// What is left here is only what is specific to jsonl.
